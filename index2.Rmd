## What interested you in this position? {data-background="img/sd.png" data-background-position="60% 90%" data-background-size="30%" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

<br>

Data Storyteller plays to my strengths of transforming research, analysis, and writing into something relatable. Conceiving a novel idea, maturing it with data to make it falsifiable, then weaving this into a narrative is my creative vehicle to turn raw numbers or screen pixels into a compelling story.    

---

## Why /Data? {data-background="img/sd2.png" data-background-position="90% 20%" data-background-size="40%" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"}  

<br>

I make data-driven tools for better decision making and to push knowledge boundaries. It’s rewarding because few people can do what I do. However, it lacks tangible client and product focus and there are more applied opportunities to focus my output using diverse collaborative energy to reach more people. 

/Data is people-focused on everyday products with wide collaborative capacity in a data sandbox. This is an opportunity goldmine to sell creative data stories.

---  

## What sets you apart from the rest?

<br>

Perhaps best described by a now friend who summarised their initial thoughts about me after we first met, verbatim.  

<br> 

> Contrarian is an understatement. You use elevated language and eloquence to take charge of a conversation and hold presence in a particular space. Once you figure out what you want, you go for it.

## My favourite /Data team value {data-background="img/sd3.png" data-background-position="80% 50%" data-background-size="40%" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"}  

<br> 

#### Attention to detail

My day-to-day is foraging in messy data to find patterns and running numbers through analyses to make something useful out of nothing remarkable. This makes attention to detail a critical and consistent element in my life.  

<br>

My 10 years experience as a freelance copy-editor also helps with this consistency.

## Tell us something you are most proud of in your life {data-background="img/pm.jpg" data-background-position="10% 30%" data-background-size="30%" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"}  

<br>

After giving a seminar at the International Society for Conservation Biology annual meeting in Colombia, I skipped my return flight to Australia and instead stayed for six months.      

<br> 

Deciding to abandon safe and comfortable for foreign and enlightening was one of my most valued life decisions. I ended up submitting my PhD thesis from a hammock in Medellin.

## Book recommendation {data-background="img/rf.jpeg" data-background-position="80% 50%" data-background-size="30%" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"}

<br>

[_‘Surely you’re joking, Mr Feynman’_](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041), by theoretical physicist, Nobel Laureate, science communicator, and author Richard P. Feynman.   

From playing bongos in his spare time to pioneering research that led to the Manhattan Project, his charm and achievements were almost as incredible as his uncanny ability to teach quantum mechanics to a 6-year-old. You don’t need to be into science to appreciate this autobiography; his childlike curiosity inspires you to continuously learn and seek patterns and pleasures in the smallest things in life.

## Salary expectations

<br> 

Commensurate on my experience, my expected negotiable salary is $75K-$85K
